        <p>Explore my 3D Sphere made with Python in TouchDesigner. This project is an exploration of color, light, and movement using SOPs and TOPs. Instead of aiming for realism, I focused on abstractionâ€”using the disco ball as a canvas for vibrant, shifting colors.

            I played with reflections, textures, and distortions to create a dynamic, ever-changing surface. The biggest challenge was balancing fluid motion with bold color transformations.
            
            I want viewers to feel immersed in a hypnotic play of light, as if stepping into a digital prism. This project pushed my understanding of real-time 3D manipulation, and I see it evolving into more interactive, audio-reactive visuals.

        <!-- Explanation for Customized VJ Mixer -->
        <p class="vj-mixer-description">
            This was made with TouchDesigner, GLSL, Python, and NDI Output. 
            This custom video mixer transforms live visuals into an audio-reactive, real-time performance tool. 
            Originally <a href="https://github.com/Richard-Burns/SimpleMixer" target="_blank" class="inline-link">a downloadable GitHub project</a>, 
            I restructured and customized it to seamlessly integrate my own assets, 
            making them dynamically responsive to music. All of the TouchDesigner-based assets are mine, and the GLSL shaders were downloaded from Shadertoy. <br><br>
            
            Designed for Visual Jamming & Live VJing, it features: <br>
            - <strong>NDI Output</strong> for professional streaming setups. <br>
            - <strong>GLSL Shaders Customization</strong> to enhance motion effects. <br>
            - <strong>Organized and Audio Reactivity System</strong> for structured yet experimental performances. <br><br>
            
            This mixer allows me to improvise visuals during performances while keeping elements finely controlled. 
            It bridges my animation practice with live media arts, making real-time creation intuitive and expressive.

    <p class="visual-jams-description">
        Working with my peers is one of the things that makes me feel the most alive. As a Fine Arts student, 
        I've been observing the lack of spontaneity in collaboration, especially in digital art. This is why 
        this initiative of creating in real-time with others was the best decision I could take as an artist and 
        human being. The essence of jamming is extremely important in my practice because it builds my character 
        and it gives life to what I intend to create. I've been collaborating with musicians with electronic and 
        jazz backgrounds. I've also experienced movement in real-time with contemporary dancers. We had a project 
        last year called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vibetribecollectivemtl/" target="_blank" 
        class="inline-link">Vibe Tribe collective</a>. I am now building this idea of sustaining the visual jams 
        in a more consistent way. In the documentation I provide, it is possible to see the different ways I 
        connect devices to each other.
