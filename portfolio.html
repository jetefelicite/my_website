                    Between performance and installation, Loïc Minty and I created an audiovisual organism that responded to its environment. Built from scratch, the system fed on ambient sound, sporadically activating pottery recordings and projections of plant celluloid and ceramic-print animations gathered during the residency. This generative ecosystem was then performed live using Carmen Abdallah’s instruments, staging a dialogue between the unpredictability of the natural world and the human capacity to adapt.

Piezo microphones dispersed through the space functioned like a nervous system, sending signals to a TouchDesigner and MaxMSP interface that reacted to movement and low-frequency ground vibrations. The installation opened the performance frame, inviting the surrounding environment—and the public—into active participation.

Developed for the Jardin de Silice, the work sought to foster a sense of communion between visitors and the site’s history through sound and image. Drawing on narrativity as a tool for immersion, we expanded the location’s sense of fantasy by researching and gathering stories connected to the space.
