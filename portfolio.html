        <p>Explore my 3D Sphere made with Python in TouchDesigner. This project is an exploration of color, light, and movement using SOPs and TOPs. Instead of aiming for realism, I focused on abstractionâ€”using the disco ball as a canvas for vibrant, shifting colors.

            I played with reflections, textures, and distortions to create a dynamic, ever-changing surface. The biggest challenge was balancing fluid motion with bold color transformations.
            
            I want viewers to feel immersed in a hypnotic play of light, as if stepping into a digital prism. This project pushed my understanding of real-time 3D manipulation, and I see it evolving into more interactive, audio-reactive visuals.

        <!-- Explanation for Customized VJ Mixer -->
        <p class="vj-mixer-description">
            This was made with TouchDesigner, GLSL, Python, and NDI Output. 
            This custom video mixer transforms live visuals into an audio-reactive, real-time performance tool. 
            Originally <a href="https://github.com/Richard-Burns/SimpleMixer" target="_blank" class="inline-link">a downloadable GitHub project</a>, 
            I restructured and customized it to seamlessly integrate my own assets, 
            making them dynamically responsive to music. All of the TouchDesigner-based assets are mine, and the GLSL shaders were downloaded from Shadertoy. <br><br>
            
            Designed for Visual Jamming & Live VJing, it features: <br>
            - <strong>NDI Output</strong> for professional streaming setups. <br>
            - <strong>GLSL Shaders Customization</strong> to enhance motion effects. <br>
            - <strong>Organized and Audio Reactivity System</strong> for structured yet experimental performances. <br><br>
            
            This mixer allows me to improvise visuals during performances while keeping elements finely controlled. 
            It bridges my animation practice with live media arts, making real-time creation intuitive and expressive.

    <p class="visual-jams-description">
        Working with my peers is one of the things that makes me feel the most alive. As a Fine Arts student, 
        I've been observing the lack of spontaneity in collaboration, especially in digital art. This is why 
        this initiative of creating in real-time with others was the best decision I could take as an artist and 
        human being. The essence of jamming is extremely important in my practice because it builds my character 
        and it gives life to what I intend to create. I've been collaborating with musicians with electronic and 
        jazz backgrounds. I've also experienced movement in real-time with contemporary dancers. We had a project 
        last year called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vibetribecollectivemtl/" target="_blank" 
        class="inline-link">Vibe Tribe collective</a>. I am now building this idea of sustaining the visual jams 
        in a more consistent way. In the documentation I provide, it is possible to see the different ways I 
        connect devices to each other.

            This section explores my critical reflections on the intersection of media, art, and technology. 
            I engage with theoretical concepts that inform my artistic practice, reflecting on how digital tools, 
            analog processes, and live performance interact in contemporary visual culture.

        <p>
            I aim to contribute to the broader conversation about visual storytelling, pushing the boundaries of 
            how we perceive and interact with moving images in performance and installation contexts.

    <h3 class="disco-ball-title">Hybrid Animation Synthesis: Redefining Real-Time Performance through Embodied Interaction</h3>
    
    <p>
        This project aims to create an affordable and flexible instrument that allows artists to jam with
        hand-made animations in real time, combining analog and digital processes to enhance visual
        performance. While digital tools and AI-generated imagery dominate modern workflows,
        hand-made animation remains a vital form of artistic expression. It fosters embodied cognition,
        creativity, intuition, and spontaneity, offering a unique visual language that automated tools
        often cant replicate. Most current video synthesis tools are either prohibitively expensive or
        restrictive, focusing on pre-set effects instead of offering real artistic control. This project seeks
        to address these limitations by developing a tool that enables artists to shape their animations
        dynamically. By blending analog effects with digital control, the instrument provides a more
        intuitive, flexible approach to animation. It also introduces the concept of visual
        jamsâ€”interactive performances where multiple artists collaborate to create and shape
        animations in real time. The project also seeks to address the gender imbalance in video
        synthesis, which has been historically shaped by male pioneers like Nam June Paik. By
        focusing on creative freedom and inclusivity, it aims to open the field to a broader range of
        artists, especially those who have been historically underrepresented. Inspired by the work of
        Guillaume VallÃ©e, who emphasizes materiality and process, the project rejects the idea that
        analog techniques are merely nostalgic. VallÃ©eâ€™s work embraces imperfections and the
        physicality of materials as essential to creative expression. Similarly, this synthesizer allows
        artists to experiment with their animations, blending them with analog effects in real time,
        offering new possibilities for creative exploration. In the end, the instrument aims to democratize
        the creative process, inviting anyoneâ€”regardless of technical backgroundâ€”to engage with and
        shape evolving visual narratives. This will transform animation into a dynamic, participatory
        practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a student-researcher, my role in this project is to design an develop a hybrid visual synthesizer that allows for real-time interaction hand-made animations. I will be responsible for both the conceptual and technical aspects, including building the necessary hardware and software components, testing different analog and digital processes, and ensuring the system is intuitive and accessible for artists. Additionally, I will document creative and technical development, analyze how embodied interaction influences animation, and explore how this tool can contribute to the field of visual performance. Through live visual jam sessions and experimentation, I aim to refine the synthesizer's functionality and artistic potential.
