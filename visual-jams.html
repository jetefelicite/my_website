                    <h3>Audio-reactivity</h3>
                    <p>This is footage of the first time I connected my sound card to one of the musician's sound card so I could get the exact data from their device. They were using Ableton Live. It was fascinating to see with such a simple abstract pattern the different intricacies of the layers of their music.</p>

                    <h3>Exploring Analog Audio-reactivity</h3>
                    <p>This got me thinking how could I bring the audio-reactivity concept with analog instruments like trumpets or percussions? So I also had an output of an external microphone close to their stage.</p>

                    <h3>Beginning of interactivity with movements</h3>
                    <p>For this jam, I experimented with real-time visuals responding to multiple inputs. The result was a dynamic interplay between sound and imagery, creating an immersive experience. With a webcam I made the dancers see themself on the projection wall, then I composited their silhouettes with my visuals.</p>

                    <h3>Developping movement interactivity</h3>
                    <p>This was my first attempt at using the motion sensor Kinect, which is way more accurate and allows you to play with 3 dimensions and textures. On this video, the kinect was connected to my computer with the network system NDI.</p>

                    <h3>Beginning of interactive performance</h3>
                    <p>I ended up familiarising myself with the Kinect and be able to use it in performance with real-time compositing on Touchdesigner. It was very moving to see the emphasis on the dancers from different angles. It makes it even more alive.</p>

                    <h3>Analog compositing</h3>
                    <p>After starting to become comfortable with real-time compositing techniques, one of my goal was to pursue in this direction with analog animation. I explored in many different ways but started with the good old 70s VJ technique: the liquid lights.</p>
